Which packet here is the first "data" packet?
(i.e. the first packet that isn't part of the three way handshake)
  Who sends the first data packet, the client or the host?
  What kind of information do we expect that packet to contain?

15 has the http request

What IP address is the "client" and which is the "server"?
  How can you tell? (there are multiple ways to deduce this...)

syn flag

When does the server start transmitting data to the client?
  After that, how many packets are sent to the client before the client ACKs?

16
asks on 17

Something interesting is happening between packets 45-66, what explanation
would you offer for this behavior?
ack is staying the same so client must not be 

In which packet does the client request the connection to close?
client requests is 98
